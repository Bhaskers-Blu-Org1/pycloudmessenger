## pycloudmessenger
The purpose of this project is to provide sample code for interacting with various messaging based cloud patforms provided by IBM Research Ireland.


## Install

#### git

[git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free open source distributed version control system used to manage and maintain the 
`castor-messaging` sample source code.

Follow [these instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install 
[git](https://git-scm.com/) on your local machine.

After [git](https://git-scm.com/) is installed, run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/IBM/pycloudmessenger.git
```

which creates a copy of the sample source code in this repository in a directory named `pycloudmessenger` on your local machine.

#### Python

This sample code uses [Python](https://www.python.org/). A minimum version of `3.5` is required; version `3.7` is preferred.

###### Linux
Python is typically pre-installed on Linux. Execute the following command to determine what version is installed:

```
python -V 
```

If the version of Python installed on your Linux machine is less than `3.5`, update Python using your Linux distribution's package manager. 

###### Windows & Mac OS X

Follow [these instructions](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download and install Python on Windows and Mac OS X.
